Data was scraped from GitHub API by filtering users in Seattle with public repositories and gathering their profile information and activity metrics.
An interesting finding was that despite a high number of followers, many developers in Seattle have only a few public repositories, indicating potential under utilization of their profiles.
I recommend that developers in Seattle enhance their online presence by increasing contributing to public repositories, to improve visibility, community  engagement and opportunities in the tech scene.
